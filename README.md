# IOT-Google-sensorboard
This is repository for the final assignment. Its aim is to provide the code necessary to make the Google SensorBoard to work with an Rasberry pi 3B+.

The class board.py has been modified to access directly to the sensors as they were returning errors on the original program.


# Moisture sensor

For the aim of a final project, a moisture sensor has been added. To make it work, the idea is to connect an Arduino through the serial port to the rasberry.
